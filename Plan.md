## Step 1: Create 16x16 grid
- Create a grid to occupy the entire container
 - Use a function that takes an argument.
 - Use it to create 16 rows and 16 cells in each row.

### Step 1: Pseudocode
- A function takes a single argument num
- Rows are created based on the value using flexbox
    - loop through from 1 to the value for this
- Cells are created inside the rows using flexbox
    - loop through from 1 to the value for this
- Call the function with num = 16

## Step 2: Adjust the number of grid cells
- Enable the user to input the number of cells they want per row
- Clear the existing contents on the div when the button is clicked

### Step 2: Pseudocode
- Create a button click event 
- Pick the user input and store it in a variable
- Pass the variable to the function
- clear the value of the input
